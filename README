This is somewhat different take on how to use Docker; instead of
shipping binary images (well, obviously, you can, if you want to, but
I'd rather not), use this Dockerfile hierarchy to build your own
'hnet' test/play environment!

Known dependencies:

- docker.io (usable as 'docker')
- git (to get this)
- debootstrap (to build debian32 variant)
- make

Assumptions:

- hnet repository clone at $(HOME)/hnet
- hnet/netkit/fs has been built (i.o.w. 'make filesystem' done there)

Features:

+ Debian-based ~development setup
 + stable (aka jessie aka 8.x)

+ Ubuntu-based ~development setup
 + LTS (aka 14.04)

- Buildbot 
 + master (using Debian stable)
 + slaves running <X> setup and building the 'generic' version with gcc/clang
 - slave running Debian and building two OpenWRT versions
  - 'trunk' (from official routing + other repositories)
  - 'latest' (from hnet-routing fork)

Known misfeatures:

- builds failing due to configure getpwd failing?

=> you're probably running on BTRFS; please use BTRFS backend (add -d
-s btrfs to docker daemon start-up arguments (e.g. at
/etc/default/docker) and hope it addresses the problem)
